# Promise-based CLI Tool - Refactoring Exercise

This project demonstrates the refactoring of a callback-based CLI application to use Promises with .then()/.catch() chaining. It's part of a learning exercise focused on understanding how to convert nested callbacks to a more maintainable Promise-based approach.


## Project Structure

- \cli-callback.js\ - Original implementation using nested callbacks
- \cli-promise.js\ - Refactored implementation using Promises
- \COMPARISON.md\ - Detailed analysis of both implementations
- \ile.txt\ - Sample file for reading operations
- \log.txt\ - Output file for logging operations
